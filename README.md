Discrete Figures AI: Seq2Seq of Dance Data (Mikiko + Daito Manabe + Kyle McDonald)

This repo contains the code I developed for a custom seq2seq model to encode / decode motion capture data for the Discrete Figures performance in 2018 at Gray Area, San Francisco, CA. For more information on the technical aspects, please refer to Kyle McDonald's (https://medium.com/@kcimc/discrete-figures-7d9e9c275c47)[medium post].
